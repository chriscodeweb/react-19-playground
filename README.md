# React 19 Playground (TypeScript version, not finished yet)

This is a playground for some of the new updates in React 19 - hooks and other features. Feel free to update this with any improvements/bug fixes and/or more relevant examples! I've tried to leave more comments in the code, to hopefully offer some extra insights.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5500 to view the app in the browser.

The sidebar will show a list of all the examples and you can click on each example to view the result of the code, and the code snippet of the example right below it.

The examples in here are inspired from the ones given by Brad Traversy (TraversyMedia) and expanded upon, thanks Brad!
