# React 19 Playground (TypeScript version)
#### (not finished yet, updated to example 4)

This is a fork from (https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-19-playground).

I am trying to convert this to a typescript version for study purpuse. 

This playgroudn uses some of the new updates in React 19 - hooks and other features. Feel free to update this with any improvements/bug fixes and/or more relevant examples! I've tried to leave more comments in the code, to hopefully offer some extra insights.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5500 to view the app in the browser.


## Automation
To generate the codesnippet file run:

```bash
npm run extract-snippets
```

src/assets/CodeSnippets.ts  will be updated accordingly.


The sidebar will show a list of all the examples and you can click on each example to view the result of the code, and the code snippet of the example right below it.
